# Mine sweeper in Python!

This is a not so simple implementation of mine sweeper game (best known from Windows operating system) in Python language. It is a single-person project, started only for learning purposes. But I don't mind if you want to check it out and play! Right now you can try it in command line interface, but soon i will add option to play it in GUI.

Requirements:
-----
 - [pipenv](https://github.com/pypa/pipenv)  
 - [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv)

Running game in CLI:
-----

    $ pipenv run python cli.py

Goals:
-----
 - get used with attrs  
 - learn gui programming with python  
 - tinker a lot  
 - have fun!
